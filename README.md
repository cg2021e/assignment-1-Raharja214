# Assignment 2
1. Create a 3D definition of the object being photographed in your very first assignment.
2. Draw the object twice—on the left and on the right half of the canvas—with the two perspectives corresponding to the two photos selected in the previous assignment.
3. Add a little cube in the center of canvas, right between the two objects.
4. Set the cube to glow white and become a light source.
5. Add an ambient effect with an intensity of 0.abc to both objects, where the value of abc is the last three digits of your Student ID plus 200.
6. Add a diffuse effect to both objects. 
7. Add a plastic specular effect for the left object. 
8. Add a metal specular effect for the object on the right. 
9. Set the cube so that it can be moved upward with the W key-button and downward with the S key-button. 
10. Set the camera to move leftward and rightward linearly (not orbitally) using the A and D key-buttons.
